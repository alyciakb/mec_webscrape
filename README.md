# mec_webscrape

Minor scrape of MEC.ca using Scrapy and css queries to obtain product titles, rating (out of 5 stars), number of reviews, product category and subcategory.

EDA to discover more about the products that are not rated, have few ratings, or have a low rating. Would be used as a starting point to ask more questions.
